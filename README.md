# Overview
Sloth is a decent UCI chess engine made with C++, although significant parts of its source code are written in a C stylish code.

Sloth is a beginner project, and can therefore not be compared/matched against other powerful engines like Stockfish. It currently uses Hand 
Crafted Evaluation, but there are plans to implement NNUE evaluation in the future

# Rating
Sloth has not received a CCRL rating yet, however, it does play online every once in a while. The link to its Lichess account is

# What is this project based on?
Sloth is based on the [BBC chess engine](https://www.chessprogramming.org/BBC) made by 
[Maksym Korzh (Code Monkey King)](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Maksim_Korzh). He, alongside his engine, has brought me into a 
whole new world of chess. And for that, I will always be grateful. Without his knowledge, none of this would be possible.
